# Fingerprint_Authentication


**This app is simply meant to serve as a demo and guide of how to do fingerprint authentication in Android using the device's fingerprint reader.** The content of this app can be applied for a variety of purposes such as:
- Allowing only authorized users to access certain features of an app by requiring them to scan their finger.
- Serving as a verification system for visitors entering a house by requiring them to place their finger on the fingerprint reader. 

Essentially, the app is meant to model how to implement fingerprint authentication in an Android app. This feature can then be adapted into other apps for a variety of uses. *For my more
extensive GitHub projects, you can check out [this repository](https://github.com/ishaanjav/Face_Analyzer) on [Analyzing Faces](https://github.com/ishaanjav/Face_Analyzer) 
by using the Microsoft Face API.*
