# Fingerprint_Authentication
**This app is simply meant to serve as a demo and guide of how to do fingerprint authentication in Android.** The content of this app can be 
applied for a variety of purposes such as allowing only authorized users to access certain features of an app or possibly serve as a 
verification system for visitors entering a house. Essentially, it is meant to model how to implement fingerprint authentication. *For my more
extensive GitHub projects, you can check out [this repository](https://github.com/ishaanjav/Face_Analyzer) on [Analyzing Faces](https://github.com/ishaanjav/Face_Analyzer) 
by using the Microsoft Face API.*
